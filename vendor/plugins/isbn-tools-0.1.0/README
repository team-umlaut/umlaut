== ISBN-Tools for Ruby

This library provides the ability to manipulate ISBN numbers.
It knows about ISBN-10 and ISBN-13 numbers, has the ability to
check if they are valid and convert from one format to the other.
It can, of course, compute the check digit of both formats.

Finally, it has the ability to hyphenate ISBN numbers for the
following group identifiers: 0, 1 and 2.  Note that only hyphenation
methods need to know about ranges, so all others methods (validity, 
checksum computations and number conversions) can be used with ISBN 
numbers from any group.

Other ranges could be added on request but I would need samples
ISBN to check the result.

== Usage

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'isbn/tools'

  isbn_good = "2800107766"
  isbn_bad = "2810107766"

  def check_and_hyphenate(isbn)
    if ISBN_Tools.is_valid?(isbn)
      puts ISBN_Tools.hyphenate(isbn)
    else
      cksum = ISBN_Tools.compute_check_digit(isbn)
      puts "Invalid ISBN number [#{isbn}]. Checksum should be #{cksum}"
    end
  end

  check_and_hyphenate isbn_good # => 2-8001-0776-6
  check_and_hyphenate isbn_bad  # => Invalid ISBN number [2810107766]. Checksum should be 9
