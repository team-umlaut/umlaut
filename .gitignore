# as we need a mysql db, we can't distro a database.yml
# for test dummy app that works out of box, so leave it
# out of git so developers can use their own without trouble.
# UPDATE: in order to test on travis-ci.org we now include the
# database.yml and therefore comment out this .gitignore item.
# Travis allows us to test with MySQL.
